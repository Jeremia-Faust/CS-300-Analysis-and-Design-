# CS-300-Analysis-and-Design-



    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    
We were tasked to use a data structure to read and manipulate data from a text file. The data structures we could choose from were vector, hash table or binary data tree. We needed to have the load and parse data from file into a data structure. We then needed to sort that data and print it. we also needed to received user input on a particular piece search the data for with the user input then print that data out.

    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. 
    
We started with project by writing the program by using pseudocode. I used old assignments, the reading, and the web to get a good idea on how I want my code to look. It is very important to understand  data structured and how they work due to in every program you will need to work with them to control that data. Data can be anything and using data structures we can manipulate the data to do everything that is needed. 

    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? 
    
We were allowed to use code from previous assignments. Originally, I chose a hash table, so I loaded up the hash table assignment and start to change the code to fit the assignment. Unfortunately, I ran into problems right away and approached a few tutors for help. For some reason I was having an issue loading the data into the hash table and the help I got could not figure out the issues so after talking with my professor, it was decided to use a different data structure, so I played around with vectors and link lists and in the end, I decided on the binary data tree.  

    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    
This project taught me that coding for me with most likely be a group effort as I like to ask a lot of questions when I get stuck to move on. I learned if there is a problem and if there is not fix that I can figure out ask for help. A lot of time someone else has already work through that same problem. Although I did run in to a lot of issue in the end, I did make a working program and I definitely used all the resources available.

    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    
I cannot say it has evolved the way I write as I tend to already do that. I like the old motto “if it is not broke do not fix it.” the best part about coding is that a lot has been done already. I like to take old working code that I have written and reuse it, then adapt to code to it to make something completely new and different.
